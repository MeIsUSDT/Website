        <p><i><b>The problem of choosing the future profession by teenagers.</b></i></p>
        <p>This problem has always been very important. This is a universal problem of our epoch. Every generation in this or that way comes across it. The profession a person chooses in many ways determines his future life. For most people choosing a career is not an easy task. It is one of the most important decisions one makes in life. The properly chosen career makes person happy and successful for the rest of his life. Deciding on a profession is one of the most difficult options that a person has to take in his life. Its importance comes undoubtedly from the fact that this decision affects our entire life, as well as the life of the people around us, be it our family or the community we live in. Since such a decision is usually taken at a younger age, enthusiasm plays an important part in it. In this case, enthusiasm is the belief that one could change something for the better in life, and that such a decision is a major step in this direction.</p>
        <p>Today a school-leaver can choose any career he or she likes. A school-leaver can become a journalist, a dentist, a surgeon, a designer, an economist, a manager and the like. It is not easy or simple to decide what career to choose because we must take in to consideration many factors.. As is known the success or failure of adult life depends upon the choice made early in life. Young people should discuss this problem with their parents and teachers. They can also speak with friends about the career prospects. Students must consider their personal taste and kind of mind. At the same time they must satisfy the requirements of society and people’s needs in one profession or another. Life has different duration for each one of us. While for some it means one single breath; for others, it means to watch many sunsets. Life is not a continent surrounded by the ocean, but a boat being shaken by the ferocity of the waves from one direction to the next. Where is the stability of such boat? May be in life? It’s also so unstable, unexpected and volatile. What about the plans? What are they for? Do they add some stability to our future? Maybe yes, maybe not. There are several ways to adapt the boat to the ocean. To choose a profession is to adapt our boat the best we can, to waterproof its cover, to install a motor, to bring provisions.</p>
        <p>The profession we choose during our teenager years may be different than the one we want to follow as adults. The wind may change the direction of the boat , lead the boat to other waters. Life opens a thousand of possibilities, short cuts or different routes; but one should not necessarily invalidate the other. The knowledge and abilities should complement each other, never invalidate. To follow a profession may be the beginning, a step into the future. But a profession should never stop new possibilities, new professions, and new directions. We should never limit the compass.</p>
        <p>If you want to get a job to your liking you should think of it beforehand. As a matter of fact it’s not an easy task to choose your future career. Choosing a profession is not a decision to take lightly. After a lot of research and deep thinking, you may still not know exactly what you want to be, but you should at least have a better idea. Narrowing down the options is the most difficult part, and once you have that done; you'll be on your way to entering your desired profession.</p>
