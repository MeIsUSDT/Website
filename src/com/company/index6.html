        <p>ELECTROMAGNETISM</p>
        <p>Electricity is the name for a set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and flow of electric charge.</p>
        <p>THE PERIODIC TABLE</p>
        <p>Dmitri Mendeleev (Russia) discovered in 1869 that the elements could be arranged according to their atomic weights and chemical properties into a table. It was then possible to derive relationships between the properties of the elements and to predict the existence, nature and properties of then-unknown elements. Mendeleev’s periodic table is essentially the same as the one in use today. Prior to Mendeleev’s discovery, other scientists made attempts to define the nature of an element, and to catalogue and categorize the known elements.</p>
        <p>VACCINATION</p>
        <p>The idea of infecting healthy individuals with some form of the same or a similar disease in order to create an immunity has a long history in China, Africa, and India. There is also evidence that inoculation was practiced in Turkey in the early 18th Century.  Although there is some evidence that vaccination for smallpox occurred in England in the 1770s, Dr. Edward Jenner’s 1796 experiments with cowpox are usually identified as the first vaccinations. Jenner took pus from the blisters of farm workers infected with cowpox, a disease similar to but less lethal than smallpox, and exposed uninfected patients to it, making them immune to smallpox. He published his results in 1796, coining the phrase ‘vaccine’ to describe the method.</p>
        <p>HUMAN ANATOMY</p>
        <p>The modern study of human anatomy began with physician Andreas Vesalius (Belgium), whose seven-volume 1543 treatise, De fabrica corporis humani, provided a detailed, well-researched and systematic study of the human body that corrected many errors of the past.</p>
        <p>ANESTHESIA</p>
        <p>Ancient physicians used various herbs, including Solanum, opium and coca to induce unconsciousness and/or relieve pain in their patients, as well as alcohol.  There is some evidence that Medieval Arabs used an inhaled anesthetic.  In the late 12th Century, in Salerno, Italy, physicians used a ‘sleep sponge’ soaked in a solution of opium and various herbs, which was held under the patient’s nose.  The sleep sponge was used by Ugo Borgognoni and his son Theodoric (Italy) in the 13th Century. In 1275, Spanish physician Raymond Lullus invented what would later be called ether. He and Swiss physician Paracelsus experimented with animals but not humans.  In 1772, Joseph Priestley (England) discovered nitrous oxide, or laughing gas, and in 1799, British chemist Humphry Davy discovered the gas’s anesthetic properties by experimenting on himself and his friends. Morphine was discovered in 1804 by Friedrich Sertürner (Germany) but it was only widely used as an anesthetic after the invention of the hypodermic syringe.  In 1842, American physician Crawford Long became the first to use ether as an anesthetic for human surgery when he removed two small tumors from James Venable, one of his students, in a painless procedure, but the operation was not publicized until 1849.</p>
        <p>THE PRINTING PRESS</p>
        <p>Block printing was first invented in Japan in about 700 CE. Bi Sheng (China) invented movable type printing in 1040.  He made the characters from wood at first but found that ceramics worked better. Choe Yun-ui (Korea) was the first to use metal for the type, in 1234. The technology did not spread to Europe. Johannes Gutenberg (Germany) invented movable type printing independently between 1440 and 1450.  Gutenberg’s major innovation was to adapt the already-existing screw press to print his pages.  He also created a special metal alloy for the type; invented a device for moving type quickly; and developed a new, superior ink.  The result was the production of higher quality printing at a much faster pace.</p>
        <p>PAPER</p>
        <p>Although the invention of paper is traditionally attributed to Ts’ai Lun (China) in 105 CE, strong evidence indicates that the pulp process was developed in China some time earlier in the 2nd Century BCE, during the Han Dynasty. The first recipe may have included tree bark, cloth rags, hemp and fishing nets. The earliest use of paper was to wrap and pad delicate objects such as mirrors. The use of paper for writing is first seen in the 3rd Century CE. Paper was used as toilet tissue from at least the 6th Century CE. In the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE), paper was used to make tea bags, paper cups and paper napkins. In the Song Dynasty (960-1279 CE), paper was used to make bank notes, or currency.</p>
